#ï‚·What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?
"""Instantiation is a process of creating an instance or an object of a class in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
terminology.

In OOP, a class serves as a blueprint or a template for creating objects, which are instances of that class. 
When an object is created, it is said to be instantiated from the class.

The process of instantiation involves allocating memory space for the object, setting its initial values 
(or leaving them at their default values), and creating a reference to the object, which can then be used to 
access its properties and method"""
