#ï‚·What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?
"""In most cases, the appropriate relationship between the Course and Faculty classes/entities is a many-to-many
relationship.

This means that a course can be taught by multiple faculty members, and a faculty member can teach multiple courses.


To implement this relationship in object-oriented programming, you would typically use an intermediate entity or
table to represent the relationship between the two entities. For example, you could have a "TeachingAssignment" 
class/entity that connects a course with a faculty member who is teaching that course.

In this case, the "TeachingAssignment" entity would have foreign keys to both the "Course" and "Faculty" entities,
indicating which course is being taught by which faculty member. This approach allows for flexible and efficient
querying and updating of the relationships between courses and faculty members."""
